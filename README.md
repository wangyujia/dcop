dcop : Distributed Component Object Platform

In the 3-tier architecture, the important and complex unusually process is 'Business Logic Layer'.

So we abstract the basic object action and the relationship between the objects. 
And we make these logic architectures into a platform. In the platform, we think a lot of reusability, scalability, reliability and so on.

There are 3 layers: wrappers, frameworks and components.
